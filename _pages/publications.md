### *Prophetic Protest* 2021,
AJS Perspectives: The Protest Issue

Protest to God is a crucial aspect of the prophetic role. I consider the protests of Abraham, Jonah and Job's wife, and what they say about God's justice.

### *The Book of Jonah and the Theme of Exile* 2020, 
Journal for the Study of the Old Testament, Vol. 45

This article examines the exilic theme of many inner-biblical allusions in the book of Jonah. Although there are few allusions to the Babylonian exile itself, allusions to the primeval and exodus narratives focus upon and draw out the exilic motifs in those texts. The allusions characterize the prophet Jonah, accentuating his wrongdoing and dissatisfaction while also indicating a more hopeful outcome for him than the ending of the book would otherwise suggest. Furthermore, the allusions illustrate the literary approach of the author in using biblical narratives to enrich his own story while simultaneously influencing the reader’s interpretation of the texts that he evokes. This insight into the author’s techniques is informative for exploring other instances of inner-biblical allusion in the book.

### *Jacob Wrestling: Genesis 32:22-32* 2019, 
Chapter in Annunciations: Sacred Music for the Twenty-First Century, ed. George Corbett. Cambridge: Open Book Publishers.

The book was the result of a collaboration between theologians and composers to produce new pieces of biblically-informed choral music. This chapter explores the story of Jacob wrestling with an ambiguous divine figure. The research was part of my collaboration with composer Dominic de Grande ([available here](http://www.dominicdegrande.com/)).

### *Jacob and the Wife-Sister Stories* 2018, 
Jewish Bible Quarterly, Vol. 46

The article shows that the biblical account of Jacob's marriage to Rachel and Leah is a purposeful literary inversion of the wife-sister stories told of his father and grandfather.
