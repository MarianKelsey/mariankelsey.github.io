I have offered modules in introductory and advanced level Hebrew Bible and introductory and advanced level Hebrew language. I have organised and team-taught modules on Judaism, and work placement, and contributed towards a module on biblical reception in music, art and literature. I have supervised at undergraduate and Masters level and been second supervisor to doctoral students.
