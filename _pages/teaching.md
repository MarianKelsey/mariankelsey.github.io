In my university lecturing, I teach introductory and advanced level Hebrew Bible modules and introductory and advanced level Hebrew language modules. At the University of Nottingham, I also organised and team-taught modules on Judaism, and work placement, and contributed towards a module on biblical reception in music, art and literature. I supervised at undergraduate and Masters level and was second supervisor to doctoral students.

I teach in various adult education settings on topics including art and literature inspired by the Bible, biblical cities, Hebrew, and Latin.
