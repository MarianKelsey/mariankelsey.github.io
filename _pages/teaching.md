In my university lecturing, I teach introductory and advanced level Hebrew Bible modules and introductory and advanced level Hebrew language modules. At the University of Nottingham, I also organised and team-taught modules on Judaism, and work placement, and contributed towards a module on biblical reception in music, art and literature. I supervised at undergraduate and Masters level and was second supervisor to doctoral students.

I teach in various adult education settings on topics including art and literature inspired by the Bible, biblical cities, Hebrew, and Latin.


### Major modules

*Foreign Cities in the Hebrew Bible*
Students follow the literary history of foreign cities in the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament. In biblical texts, foreign cities are often portrayed as enemies. They are subject to many prophecies about their brutality to others and their violent end. The character of these cities as personified in the Bible outlived the texts in which they were born. For example, ‘Babylon’ survives into the modern day as a literary and cultural code for decadence, corruption, and imperial evil. Just as Babylon and other foreign cities were used in the Bible to shape Israelite identity in distinction from the world around it, so today we use ciphers like ‘Babylon’ to define what we are not, and therefore, who we are.

*Art and Literature Inspired by the Bible*
In this course, we will explore a range of artistic pieces inspired by biblical stories. These include paintings, sculptures, book illustrations, poetry, plays, and books—from Rembrandt to comic books, and from Dracula to Harry Potter. We will look at how artists interpret the Bible stories in different ways, and how they use biblical themes and ideas to enrich their own work. 

*Narrative in the Hebrew Bible*
Students expplore examples of narrative literature in the Bible and the elements of a literary approach to the texts. You will learn about the use of plot, characterisation, repetition and ambiguity in biblical narrative, and how biblical narrative persuasively presents its ideology (or ideologies) to its readers. You will discover how allusions, text collation and scribal editing created internal references and interdependence between various parts of ‘the’ biblical narrative. You will consider some variations of biblical narrative, namely prophetic narrative and diaspora novella, and developments in biblical narrative beyond and outside the Hebrew Bible.
