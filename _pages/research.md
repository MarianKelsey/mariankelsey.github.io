My main area of research is the literary context of Second Temple period biblical literature, specifically the interrelationship of text, belief and community. Through my doctoral thesis, I demonstrated how the book of Jonah used inner-biblical allusions and literary motifs to address the problematic issue of God’s sovereignty in light of Jerusalem’s destruction. I have also published on elements of the Jacob cycle, collaborated in the production of biblically-informed art, and written about the use of the Hebrew Bible within the New Testament. I am currently researching the literary function of cities within the Hebrew Bible.
