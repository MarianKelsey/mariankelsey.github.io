In my research, I focus on the literary context of biblical literature, in particular the interrelationship of text, belief and community. 

My latest publication was ‘The Book of Jonah and the Theme of Exile,’ which appeared in JSOT this year. I have also published on elements of the Jacob cycle, and written about the use of the Hebrew Bible within the New Testament. 

I am currently researching the literary function of cities within the Bible and the reception of city-traditions in later Jewish and Christian literature and culture. Meanwhile, I am working with a New Testament scholar on a paper examining the use of Hosea in the Matthean infancy narrative. 

My research draws on other disciplines to bring fresh perspectives to biblical studies: in particular, literary approaches to the texts, and insights from other disciplines into the interplay of texts, community formation, and cultural identity.
