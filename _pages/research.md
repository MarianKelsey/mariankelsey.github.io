In my research, I focus on the literary context of biblical literature, in particular the interrelationship of text, belief and community. My latest publication was ‘The Book of Jonah and the Theme of Exile,’ which appeared in JSOT this year. I have also published on elements of the Jacob cycle, and written about the use of the Hebrew Bible within the New Testament. I am currently researching the literary function of cities within the Bible and the reception of city-traditions in later Jewish and Christian literature and culture. Meanwhile, I am working with a New Testament scholar on a paper examining the use of Hosea in the Matthean infancy narrative. My research draws on other disciplines to bring fresh perspectives to biblical studies: in particular, literary approaches to the texts, and insights from other disciplines into the interplay of texts, community formation, and cultural identity.

### Current research project

#### *The Literary Function of Cities in the Hebrew Bible*
The literary and imaginative depictions of places express the experiences and self-understanding of a culture. For example, locations such as Atlantis, Troy and Camelot function in Western culture not only as place-names, but also as concepts. They encapsulate the notion of a bygone golden age to which the present age fails to compare, yet is somehow the legitimate successor. The concepts of these places are thereby formative in Western cultural identities. Similarly, the literary and imaginative depictions of places in biblical literature express and construct Israelite cultural identity. I am researching some of the paradigmatic foreign cities in biblical literature, specifically Tyre, Nineveh and Babylon. The cultural perception of these cities frames the biblical story of God’s people, their redemption and abandonment, their past losses and future hopes. The portrayals of the cities in the biblical texts reveal the development of Israel's self-understanding in distinction from other places and peoples. My research brings together analysis of the development of the literary portrayal of foreign cities over time, the function of the foreign cities in the biblical texts in their current form, and the role of the cities in shaping and illustrating Israel’s cultural identity.

### Previous research projects

#### *TheoArtistry Composers’ Scheme and Poets’ Scheme*
I collaborated with a young composer and with established poet, providing biblical research for a new choral composition for use in church worship and poetry inspired by biblical passages.


#### *Humour in the Bible Project*
I researched the use of humour in biblical texts, with particular emphasis on the book of Judges, the book of Jonah and Jesus’ parables.
