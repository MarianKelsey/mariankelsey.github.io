I tutor ancient languages (Hebrew, Greek and Latin) and biblical studies.

I offer one-to-one tutoring and group teaching. I can provide regular lessons, courses, and one-off talks. I have experience teaching students with autism and dyslexia.

Please do get in touch if you or your group would like to discuss tuition; I look forward to hearing from you!

### The World of the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament

An excursion into the historical and literary world of the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament.

I will lead you through the biblical texts, the history behind them, their theological background and teaching, the beauty of their literary expression, and the question of how to interpret them today.

We will look at questions like:

*What does the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament say about the character of God?*

*How did the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament come to be?*

*What did the texts mean to the people who first read them, and is this different from what they mean today?*

The full course is twenty lessons. They can be booked altogether, or in two blocks of ten lessons. The first ten lessons will cover the biblical books from Genesis to the end of Kings, and the next ten lessons all of the remaining books (mostly prophecy and poetry).



### Learn to Read Biblical Hebrew

Work at your own pace to learn how to read the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament in the original Hebrew.

Lessons are available individually or as part of a group. You can book lessons in blocks of ten.



### The World of the New Testament

A journey through the gospels and letters of the New Testament. 

I help students discover the gospel stories; what we really know about Jesus and is early followers; and how the texts are steeped in their Old Testament background, while also introducing something new.

We look at questions like:

*Who was Jesus, and what did he teach?*

*How did the New Testament come to be?*

*How were the texts first used, and how are they used today?*

There are ten lessons in the course.



### Learn to Read Biblical Greek

Work at your own pace to learn how to read the New Testament in the original Greek.

Lessons are available individually or as part of a group. You can book lessons in blocks of ten.



### Art and Literature Inspired by the Bible

We will explore a range of artistic pieces depicting or inspired by biblical stories. These include paintings, sculptures, poetry, plays, television and books—from Rembrandt to comic books, and from Dracula to Harry Potter. We will look at how artists interpret the Bible stories in different ways, and how they use biblical themes and ideas to enrich their own work.

There are ten lessons in the course.



### Learn a Little Latin

Take a dabble into Latin if you’re learning it for the first time, or refresh some old school Latin. We will focus on reading to understand and enjoy, rather than covering all the grammatical detail.

Lessons are available individually or as part of a group. You can book lessons in blocks of ten.



### Other lessons and talks

Please get in touch if you would like to discuss lessons or talks on any of the other subjects from my research projects or university teaching.
