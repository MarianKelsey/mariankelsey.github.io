I tutor biblical languages (Hebrew and Greek) and biblical studies.

I offer one-to-one tutoring and group teaching. I can provide regular lessons, courses, and one-off talks.

Please do get in touch if you or your group would like to discuss tuition; I look forward to hearing from you!

### Courses

#### Learn to read Biblical Hebrew

Work at your own pace to learn how to read the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament in the original Hebrew.

Lessons are available individually or as part of a group. You can book lessons in blocks of ten.



#### Learn to read Biblical Greek

Work at your own pace to learn how to read the New Testament in the original Greek.

Lessons are available individually or as part of a group. You can book lessons in blocks of ten.



#### The world of the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament

An excursion into the historical and literary world of the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament.

I will lead you through the biblical texts, the history behind them, their theological background and teaching, the beauty of their literary expression, and the question of how to interpret them today.

We will look at questions like:

*What does the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament say about the character of God?*

*How did the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament come to be?*

*What did the texts mean to the people who first read them, and is this different from what they mean today?*

The full course is twenty lessons. They can be booked altogether, or in two blocks of ten lessons. The first ten lessons will cover the biblical books from Genesis to the end of Kings, and the next ten lessons all of the remaining books (mostly prophecy and poetry).



#### Other lessons and courses

Please get in touch if you would like to discuss lessons or talks on any of the other subjects from my research projects or university teaching.
