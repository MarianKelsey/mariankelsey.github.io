I am a Hebrew Bible scholar. I am particually interested in inner-biblical allusion, literary motifs, biblical reception in art and the book of Jonah. 

I completed my PhD at the University of St Andrews. Previously I received a Masters degree with distinction in biblical studies at Durham University, and a first class MTheol (Hons) at St Andrews.

Queen of the Whales!
