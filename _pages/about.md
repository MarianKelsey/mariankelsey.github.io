I am a biblical scholar specialising in Hebrew Bible. I am particularly interested in inner-biblical allusion, literary motifs, biblical reception in art, and the books of Jonah and Ruth.

I am a Visiting Scholar at the University of St Andrews and a teacher with the Israel Institute of Biblical Studies. Previously I lectured at the University of Nottingham. I completed my PhD on the book of Jonah at the University of St Andrews, received a Masters degree with distinction in biblical studies at Durham University, and a first class MTheol (Hons) at St Andrews.
