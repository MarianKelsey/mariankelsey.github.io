I am a biblical scholar specialising in Hebrew Bible. I am particularly interested in inner-biblical allusion, literary motifs, biblical reception in art, and the book of Jonah.

I am currently a Visiting Scholar at the University of St Andrews. Previously I lectured at the University of Nottingham. I completed my PhD at the University of St Andrews, received a Masters degree with distinction in biblical studies at Durham University, and a first class MTheol (Hons) at St Andrews.

Queen of the Whales!
