### Gods & Moviemakers: The Lord of the Rings
Gods & Moviemakers is a podcast for religion / history nerds and movie lovers with hosts Joe Scales and Katie Turner. 'In many ways, The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring perfectly demonstrates most of the tropes of a "Chosen One" type: An ordinary person chosen for an extraordinary task, guided by a mentor-type figure, and aided by a loyal support system. But who is the chosen figure in this film? Is it the hobbit, Frodo, or Aragorn, the king to be?'

I was invited as the expert guest on this episode to debate who has been chosen, and what biblical imagery may be present in our two potential chosen one characters.

### The book of Jonah, the relenting of God, and the fate of Jerusalem
My PhD thesis on inner-biblical allusion in the book of Jonah will soon be published as a monograph. The findings also formed the basis of my plenary paper at the SOTS summer conference in Durham in 2018.

I will shortly be uploading a copy of the presented paper. In the meantime, read a summary of my paper and others at the conference [here](https://thinktheology.co.uk/blog/article/society_of_old_testament_study_summer_meeting_2018).



### TheoArtistry Project
The TheoArtistry Composers' Scheme and Poets' Scheme paired theologians with young composers and established poets to collaborate in producing new art inspired by biblical passages. Read about the schemes [here](https://theoartistry.org/projects/past-projects/#close).

I worked with composer [Dominic de Grande](http://www.dominicdegrande.com/) and poet [Ian Crockatt](https://stanzapoetry.org/festival/poets-artists/crockatt). Our biblical passage was Genesis 32. Find out more about the biblical passage [here](https://theoartistry.org/projects/past-projects/composers-scheme/genesis-32/). 

A documentary about the Composers' Scheme is available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2NoaJHcp2E&ab_channel=UniversityofStAndrews).

You can read a blog post about the scheme [here](https://artandtheology.org/2020/07/28/a-little-east-of-jordan-artful-devotion/).

An open-access book of essays and music resulting from the scheme is available [here](https://www.openbookpublishers.com/product/994).

The poetry from the scheme was published in a book available [here](http://www.tapsalteerie.co.uk/product/the-song-poems-of-biblical-theophany/).



### Why Study Theology?
The University of Nottingham has produced a series of short videos on why to study aspects of theology. Prof. Tom O'Loughlin interviews Nottingham TRS staff on areas of their research and teaching. See four interviews with me on different aspects of my research:

'Why study the book of Jonah?' [here](https://youtu.be/2-NACj4RYfM).

'Why study cities in the Hebrew Bible?' [here](https://youtu.be/YKc7NxhYxaU).

'Why study memory in the Hebrew Bible?' [here](https://youtu.be/kHyvfJzanTk).

### On the Creation of Knowledge
Mathematician Rudradip Biswas has launched a new podcast on the topic of how the creation of academic knowledge is defined across various disciplines.

Rudradip interviewed me for the first episode, focusing on the field of theology. Watch it [here](https://youtu.be/yHb-P1tLMeQ).
